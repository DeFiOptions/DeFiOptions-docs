# Governance

**Defi Options** is being built to function as a DAO, i.e., a decentralized autonomous organization.

Protocol settings are embedded into the smart contracts and can be managed by governance token holders, which can submit proposals for updating these settings values.

Once submitted proposals go through a voting cycle. If the majority of participants vote in favor of the proposal it gets executed and changes are applied to the protocol. Otherwise, if the proposal doesn't get enough votes for approval, it's marked as rejected resulting in no change to the protocol.
