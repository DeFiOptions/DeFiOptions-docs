# What is DeFi Options?

**Defi Options** is an open source decentralized options trading platform for Ethereum / EVM-compatible chains bringing a more capital efficient collateral allocation model and a more diversified options offer to DeFi.

Our main goal is to develop a protocol that provides an attractive, dynamic environment for both options traders and options writers for trading not only crypto options, but also foreign exchange options, commodity options and more.â€Œ

We believe options writers should be rewarded for absorbing the risk of issuing options. We also believe options buyers should have access to fair prices. And it has been with these beliefs in mind that we've designed the **Defi Options** protocol.

We invite you to visit our [GitHub page](https://github.com/DeFiOptions) for reviewing our source code, and to join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/WCeKgHNz3z) for keeping up with the protocol's latest developments.
