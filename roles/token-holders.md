# Token Holders

Token Holders ðŸ¥® collectively constitute the DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) that oversees the **Defi Options** protocol.

Through a proposal voting process they can change the parameters that govern the options exchange operations, such as:

* Credit / Debt interest rates
* The exchange's payment processing fee
* The stablecoins accepted by the exchange
* Registered underlying price feeds (against which options are written)
* Collateral model parameters (ex: volatility period, multipliers, etc)

Besides that token holders can also submit proposals for using the exchange's excess capital, for instance for being used as additional collateral for covering loans from defaulting debtors, for being invested in the protocol's continuing development, or simply for being distributed among token holders themselves.
