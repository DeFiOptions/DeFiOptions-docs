# Validators

The options exchange requires some maintenance tasks to be executed periodically for proper operation, and validators üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è are incentivized to execute these tasks. Here is a short list of them:

* Deploying new option token contracts
* Liquidating expired option token contracts
* Calling prefetch functions for updating contracts preprocessed parameters values (ex: daily price volatilities) to reduce traders gas usage
* Monitoring collateral requirements for performing early liquidation of undercollateralized options writers open positions

Upon successfully executing one or more of these tasks a validator will be rewarded with **Defi Options** governance tokens, which he/she could exchange for their monetary value, or accumulated for having a say in the governance process.
